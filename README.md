# Overview 
## This project consist of three files. 
1. **Main-class** with a start method for setting up the stage as well as the main method itself.
2. **Controller-class** with multiple check methods for capital name, flag-icons and country names. This was done in a ugly way using multiple switch statements. The submitAction method is the brains of the project and handles all of the checks using the other methods.
3. **Sample.fxml** I wanted to test out building programs using scene builder and fxml files. This file contains the html of the program, not much more to say about it.

### Features
* Changing flag icon
* Changing country name
* Visual score counter
* Final score displayed at the end
